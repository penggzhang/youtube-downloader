# youtube-downloader
A python script to download Youtube's video, audio and transcript.

Download this Python script into your local folder. Pip install two dependencies: 
- YouTube
- YouTubeTranscriptApi

Run the script to complete the downloading tasks, e.g.

`$ python downloadYoutube.py 'a_youtube_video_url'`

Please use the pair of single quotation marks to enclose the url.

You will be prompted to choose which component shall be downloaded:
1. transcript - both .srt and .txt files
2. video - .mp4 file
3. audio - .webm file
4. all above
5. just view the details of video

Choose what you want, and the code will help you collect the files into the same folder as the python script.

The .txt file is a clean-formatted script without timestamps, which is easier for reading.
